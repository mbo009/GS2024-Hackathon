# HTP (Hack the Pipe)
HTP is a powerful penetration testing tool designed to seamlessly integrate into your CI/CD pipeline. Its primary goal is to ensure security vulnerabilities are detected and mitigated as early as possible during the software development lifecycle. This proactive approach minimizes risks and ensures your application is robust against various attack vectors.
## Seamless CI/CD integration
HTP is specifically crafted to fit into modern DevOps workflows. By embedding security testing directly into your CI/CD pipeline, developers can receive immediate feedback about potential vulnerabilities with every build, merge, or deployment.
## Extensive Test Configuration
Configuration is straightforward yet powerful, offering extensive customization options through JSON files. This allows for easy definition of test parameters, enabling users to adapt the tool to their unique requirements without requiring deep technical expertise.

- User-defined thresholds: Configure acceptable limits for response times, payload sizes, and more.
- Scoping options: Target specific endpoints or exclude certain parts of the application from testing.
## Modularity
HTP adopts a modular architecture, where each test type is treated as an independent module. This design allows for maximum flexibility, enabling users to:
- Use pre-built modules for common vulnerabilities.
- Create and integrate custom modules tailored to specific needs.
- Enable or disable modules dynamically, depending on the requirements of a particular build or environment.
### Modules examples
- SQL injection
- CMD injection
- DOS attack
- Authentication verification
- Response codes verification
- File size limit verification
## Advanced Reporting
Once the testing process is complete, HTP generates detailed reports in multiple formats to cater to various audiences, including developers, security analysts, and management.
### Report Formats

- JSON Output: A machine-readable format for integration with other tools or further analysis.
- HTML View: A visually appealing, interactive report that highlights:
	- Vulnerability details with severity levels.
	- Affected endpoints or components.

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time Alerts: Notify teams instantly of critical vulnerabilities via email, Slack, or other communication channels.
- AI-driven Analysis: Incorporate machine learning to detect anomalous patterns and predict potential, not known before, vulnerabilities.
